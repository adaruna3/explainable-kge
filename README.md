# Explainable Knowledge Graph Embedding (XKGE)
Supporting code for [XKGE]() paper.

## Pre-requisites
1. This repo has been tested for a system running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, PyTorch (1.2.0), and 
hardware CPU or Nvidia GPU (GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or better).
2. For GPU functionality Nvidia drivers, CUDA, and cuDNN are required.

## Installation
1. To install using conda run: `conda env create -f xkge_env.yml` in the repo root and activate
environment via `conda activate xkge_env`

## Check install
After activating the environment, run `python`. Python version 3.6 should run. Next, check if `import torch` works.
Next, for GPU usage check if `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `True`. If all these checks passed, the installation should
be working.
